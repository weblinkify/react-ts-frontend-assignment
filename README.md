# React TypeScript Frontend Assignment

## Introduction

Welcome to the React TypeScript Frontend Assignment! This project is a user dashboard application built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to view, filter, and sort a list of users, providing a smooth and interactive experience.

## Technologies Used

This project uses several key technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early.
- **Material-UI**: A framework that provides ready-to-use components following Material Design guidelines.
- **Axios**: A library for making HTTP requests.

## Development Process

The development of this application involved setting up a React environment, creating components for user listings, and implementing features like sorting and filtering.

## Getting Started

To set up this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
- **npm**: The Node package manager.

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:weblinkify/react-ts-frontend-assignment.git
   cd react-ts-frontend-assignment
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application: Launch the development server with:**:

   ````bash
   npm start
    ```
   After this, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.

   ````

4. **To create a production-ready build of the app, run**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. **To execute the test suite, you can use:**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This command runs the tests you've written to ensure everything works as expected. For example, it
   checks whether user data is fetched correctly and that the components render properly.
